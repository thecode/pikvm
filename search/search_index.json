Each USB device uses so-called endpoints to communicate with the host. Depending on the type, the device consumes a different number of endpoints, while their total number is limited by the capabilities of the chip, for Raspberry Pi it is 8.</p> <p>It is quite difficult to calculate the number of endpoints used, but in the case of PiKVM, you can focus on the following numbers:</p> Device Endpoints Keyboard, mouse 1 for each Mass Storage Drive 2 for each USB Ethernet, USB Serial 3 for each <p>V2 and V3 emulates one mouse by default, V4 emulates two mouses. Thus, V2 and V3 use 4 endpoints, and V4 uses 5 by default.</p> <p>Creating an axtra Mass Storage Drive consumes additional endpoints, as well as USB Serial and USB Ethernet, so only a limited number of devices can be selected for the final configuration, for example, one USB Ethernet.</p> <p>If you need something more non-standard, you can disable the regular Mass Storage Drive and the additional mouse (on V4) to free up some extra endpoints.</p> <p>The <code>kvmd-otg</code> service is responsible for setting up USB emulation.

RPi5 does not provide significant improvements comapred to RPi4, so you can use any build based on RPi4, including PiKVM V3 or V4.</li> <li>RPi5 is not compatible with PiKVM V4 HAT because of due to the difference in form factor with RPi4.</li> <li>What about dual CSI slots and hardware coding? We are investigating this.</li> </ul> Can I connect multiple servers to a single PiKVM? <p>Yes, but it requires additional work to set up. See this page.</p> How can I get the access to PiKVM in my local network over Internet? <p>You can use port forwarding for port 443 on your router if it has an external IP address. In all other cases, you can use the excellent free VPN service Tailscale, which can be configured on PiKVM with a few simple commands.</p> Can I assign a static IP to a PiKVM <p>Edit file <code>/etc/systemd/network/eth0.network</code> for Ethernet or <code>wlan0.network</code> for Wi-Fi and edit the <code>[Network]</code> section:</p> <pre><code>[Network]\nAddress=192.168.x.x/24\nGateway=192.168.x.x\nDNS=192.168.x.x\nDNS=192.168.x.x\n</code></pre> <p>If you're using Wi-Fi but you don't have <code>/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network</code> file, then first you will need to <code>migrate the Wi-Fi settings from</code>netctl<code>to</code>systemd-networkd`.</p> Can I use PiKVM for gaming? <p>No, because:</p> <ul> <li>For HDMI-CSI bridge, bus bandwidth is not enough to transmit more than 1080p50.</li> <li>For HDMI-USB dongle, high latency and low video quality.</li> <li>General hardware video capture differs from software streaming and introduces additional latency.</li> </ul> Can PiKVM do 4K video? <ul> <li>For HDMI-CSI bridge, no. There is not enough bandwidth in the CSI bus for that much data. 1080p50 will max out the bandwidth.</li> <li>For the USB capture devices: technically yes, they will downsample to something smaller to meet the USB 2.0 bandwidth limitations, so the source may be 4k, but the stream will not.</li> <li>The 4K real-time video will not fit through the network anyway.</li> </ul> Where does the cursor/video latency come from? <p>Here is the chain of transferring an image to your browser or VNC client.</p> <p><code>Capture device -&gt; Compression -&gt; Network -&gt; Decompression -&gt; Rendering</code></p> <p>100-200ms is very, very fast for this. But we are working to speed things up even more.</p> Does PiKVM support sound? <p>Yes but the only officially supported version is the PiKVM V3+ devices, V2 we will attempt best effort but ultimatly we do not support CSI modules or USB.</p> Can I power the Pi via PoE? <p>Yes! But you still need a splitter to ensure you isolate the 5v connection between the Raspberry Pi and host PC to prevent backpower issues that can cause instability or damage to either the host PC or the Pi. Power/Data cable + USB power blocker would work.</p> Do I need a power splitter? Why do I need one? <ul> <li>Yes for RPi4 - Please see the main readme for splitter types listed under V2 hardware</li> <li>Yes for Zero W and Zero W 2, if using dedicated power you still need to split the power from the data towards the target. If using the target for power, this is not needed.</li> <li>This is not needed if you have a PiKVM V3, as the HAT splits power and signal on the board.</li> </ul> Can I use PiKVM with non-Raspberry Pi boards (Orange, Nano, etc)? <p>Yes, but you will have to prepare the operating system yourself. For the PiKVM software, you will need to replace some config files (such as UDEV rules). If you are a developer or an experienced system administrator, you will not have any problems with this. In addition, we are open to patches. If you need help with this, please contact us via Discord (#unofficial_ports channel).</p> Is PiKVM OS its own custom distro? <p>No. PiKVM OS is an Arch Linux ARM with our own repository for KVM-related packages. We distribute OS images (that is, our Arch Linux ARM build) to simplify installation, since PiKVM requires some tuning of the OS and special partitioning of the memory card.</p> Why is PiKVM OS based on Arch Linux ARM and not Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS? <p>There are several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Several years ago, when PiKVM was just starting out, Raspbian didn't have a minimalistic image and the transition to systemd was in full swing, which is why the distribution was not too stable.</li> <li>Raspbian did not have all the necessary packages in the repositories to satisfy most software dependencies.</li> <li>PiKVM was born as a pet project, and the founder likes Arch the most.</li> </ul> <p>However, we plan to provide an alternative OS image based on Raspbian in the future - now it is quite stable.</p> Can I use an iPad on PiKVM? <ul> <li>Yes, with the correct hardware you can control an iPad.</li> <li>In the opposite sense - yes, use VNC and use JUMP app (fully-featured but more expensive), or bVNC (cheap). RealVNC does NOT work.</li> </ul> How do I add my own SSL cert? <p>If you have a certificate (making a cert falls outside the scope of PiKVM - please reference OpenSSL documentation or use Let's Encrypt), replace keys in <code>/etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl</code>, edit <code>/etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl.conf</code> if necessary and restart <code>kvmd-nginx</code> service.</p> How do I emulate various USB devices on the target machine? <p>Please review First Steps before continuing By default this is what is set:</p> <pre><code>otg:\n    manufacturer: PiKVM\n    product: Composite KVM Device\n    vendor_id: 0x1D6B\n    product_id: 0x0104\n    serial: CAFEBABE\n</code></pre> <p>You can change how this is displayed with the following example for <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>otg:\n    manufacturer: Corsair\n    product: Corsair Gaming RGB\n    vendor_id: 0x6940\n    product_id: 0x6973\n    serial:\n</code></pre> <p>Use the following USB database to get the desired devices: https://the-sz.com/products/usbid or https://devicehunt.com.</p> Can I run a desktop on PiKVM? <p>Yes, but it's strongly not recommended OR supported as this OS should be used in read-only mode and it will need read-write enabled all of the time. Instructions here.</p> How do I blank the oled screen? <p>Please run the following: </p><pre><code># systemctl disable --now kvmd-oled kvmd-oled-reboot kvmd-oled-shutdown\n# kvmd-oled --height=32 --interval=0 --clear-on-exit --text=x\n</code></pre> To re-enable the display: <pre><code># systemctl enable --now kvmd-oled kvmd-oled-reboot kvmd-oled-shutdown\n</code></pre> How do I rotate the OLED display? <p>Please run the following: </p><pre><code>1. mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/kvmd-oled.service.d\n2.

To get <code>root</code> access, you need to use the <code>su -</code> command (minus is important) and enter the root password.</p> Where is the PiKVM configuration located? <p>Almost all KVMD (the main daemon controlling PiKVM) configuration files are located in <code>/etc/kvmd</code>. You can also find nginx configs and SSL certificates there. KVMD configs use YAML syntax. The specific platform parameters can be found in the file <code>/etc/kvmd/main.yaml</code> and you should never edit it. Use <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code> to redefine the system parameters.</p> <p>Files that are not recommended for editing have read-only permissions. If you edit any of these files, you will need to manually make changes to them when you upgrade your system. You can view the current configuration and all available KVMD parameters using the command <code>kvmd -m</code>.</p> I can't edit any file on PiKVM. Why is the system in read-only mode? <p>The PiKVM file system is always mounted in read-only mode. This measure prevents it from being damaged by a sudden power outage. To change the configuration you must first switch the filesystem to write mode using the command <code>rw</code> from root. After the changes, be sure to run the command <code>ro</code> to switch it back to read-only. If you get a message that the file system is busy, then the easiest way is to perform a <code>reboot</code>.</p> I want to get read-write filesystem all of the time <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>DON'T DO THIS</p> <p>Seriously, DON'T. Read-only mode increases the life of the memory card and protects the filesystem from power loss failures. See the question above ^ ^ ^</p> <p>You can turn it off, but don't say you weren't warned.</p> DON'T OPEN THIS SPOILER AND DON'T DO THIS <p>Okay, fine.</p> <ul> <li>Edit <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code> and change option <code>ro</code> to <code>rw</code>.</li> <li>Do the same in <code>/etc/fstab</code> for the <code>/boot</code> partition.</li> <li>Comment <code>tmpfs</code> lines in <code>/etc/fstab</code> for <code>/var/lib</code> and <code>/var/log</code>.</li> </ul> <p>But again: DON'T DO THIS</p> How to set the date, time and timezone from command line? <ul> <li>Become root with the command <code>su -</code> or <code>sudo -s</code>.</li> <li>Enable read/write with the command <code>rw</code>.</li> <li>Find your timezone string e.g. <code>timedatectl list-timezones</code> or <code>timedatectl list-timezones | grep -i australia</code>.</li> <li>Set the timezone with <code>timedatectl set-timezone &lt;YourTimeZoneHere&gt;</code> e.g. <code>timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Victoria</code>.</li> <li>Stop the time syncing service with <code>systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd</code> as this will prevent the next step if running.</li> <li>Set the time and date with <code>timedatectl set-time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</code> e.g. <code>timedatectl set-time '2023-02-26 14:50:10'</code>.</li> <li>If you have hardware clock e.g. V3+, update it with <code>hwclock --systohc</code> , then check it with <code>hwclock --show</code>.</li> <li>Switch filesystem to RO-mode with the command <code>ro</code>.</li> </ul> How do I install or remove packages in PiKVM OS? <p>PiKVM OS is based on Arch Linux ARM and uses the pacman package manager.</p> <ul> <li>Ensure the date is correct: <code>date</code>. Otherwise you may get the error <code>SSL certificate problem: certificate is not yet valid</code></li> <li>Switch filesystem to RW-mode: <code>rw</code>.</li> <li>Find some packages (<code>emacs</code> for example): <code>pacman -Ss emacs</code>.</li> <li>Install it, while keeping the system updated: <code>pacman -Syu emacs</code>.</li> <li>To only update packages without installing new ones, use <code>pacman -Syu</code></li> <li>Remove it: <code>pacman -R emacs</code>.</li> <li>Switch filesystem to RO-mode: <code>ro</code>.</li> </ul> How do I update PiKVM with the latest software? <p>This is ONLY recommended if you need a feature, otherwise this should ONLY be done if you are physically at the device and can reflash the sd card as a means of recovery. PiKVM OS is based on Arch Linux ARM and is fully updated from the repository by a regular package manager. Connect to your PiKVM via ssh and run:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure the date is correct: <code>date</code>. Otherwise you may get the error <code>SSL certificate problem: certificate is not yet valid</code></li> <li>Run the following:</li> </ul> <pre><code># date\n# rw\n# pacman -Syu\n# reboot # Allow 10 to 15 minutes for a response.\n</code></pre> <p>Pacman saves all installed packages in a compressed format so that you can roll back to the old version if something goes wrong. After you've updated and made sure everything works, (ONLY for older images, newer images has this partition expended and no longer has this issue) it makes sense to clear the package cache so that it doesn't take up space on the SD card: <code>rw; rm -rf /var/cache/pacman/pkg; ro</code>.</p> I don't need ATX functions. How do I disable this in the Web UI? <p>If you don't need ATX power control you can disable the relevant Web UI menu in <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    atx:\n        type: disabled\n</code></pre> <p>... then restart <code>kvmd</code>:</p> <pre><code># systemctl restart kvmd\n</code></pre> How do I disable the web terminal? <pre><code># systemctl disable --now kvmd-webterm\n</code></pre> How do I completely disable authorization in PiKVM? <p>Edit the file <code>/etc/kvmd/override.yaml</code>:</p> <pre><code>kvmd:\n    auth:\n        enabled: false\n</code></pre> <p>... then restart <code>kvmd</code>:</p> <pre><code>[root@pikvm ~]# systemctl restart kvmd\n</code></pre> Can I have different hostnames for each of my PiKVMs? <p>Yes! And it's easy to do! Using a SSH session or the web terminal: * Make sure you are root, run <code>rw</code> then run <code>hostnamectl set-hostname yournewhostname.domain</code>. * Optional: edit <code>/etc/kvmd/meta.yaml</code> to alter the displayed hostname in the web UI. * Run <code>ro</code> and <code>reboot</code>.</p> Why not add software support for another codec? <p>Encoding is a heavy process and will add significant latency, its best to have hardware support to avoid additional latency.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#video-problems","title":"Video problems","text":"I can see the video but I can't see the WebRTC switch <p>WebRTC is an alternative mode for the default MJPEG and it's only supported on V2+ platforms with the CSI video capture device.

If you remove the DP cable/adapter the bug will reappear.</p> <p>If none of this works, try connecting the DP cable first, boot into the BIOS, disable the CSM and shutdown (do not restart) your PC. Then, boot into the BIOS and enable the CSM before shutting down your PC. Then connect the HDMI and turn your PC on again.</p> There is no video in GRUB2, but there is before and after <p>Sometimes this can be caused by the specifics of the BIOS/UEFI and how GRUB2 works with video.</p> <p>This can be solved by enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your BIOS, usually under the Boot options. The video mode will be located in the same section. Switch the Video mode from UEFI to Legacy.</p> Why does the CSI bridge does not work with official Raspberry Pi PoE HAT? <p>Details here. The reason is that the official HAT has a built-in fan controller that conflicts with the TC358743 chip of the bridge. The solution is to disable the fan control and connect the fan to the power line so that it works continuously. To turn off the controller you need to add the line <code>disable_poe_fan=1</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>.</p> The video freezes a few seconds after the start, restarting the Web UI or VNC does not help <p>The story is here. Very very rarely, Raspberry Pi boards can have a hardware defect that causes some of the chip blocks to be unstable under normal power. The solution is to slightly increase the power supply, as you would when overclocking. Add <code>over_voltage=1</code> (or <code>over_voltage=2</code> if previous doesn't help) to <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and perform <code>reboot</code>.</p> <p>To make sure that you are facing this particular problem, first perform a diagnostic:</p> <ul> <li>Boot the PiKVM without the specified options.</li> <li>Open Web-UI and wait for freezing.</li> <li>Click <code>System -&gt; Reset Stream</code>.</li> <li>Click <code>System -&gt; Open log</code> and make sure that the log contains messages like <code>H264: Can't wait for the VCOS semaphore</code>.</li> <li>Make sure that the last message from ustreamer was <code>H264: Configuring MMAL encoder</code> (not counting messages about connecting and disconnecting stream clients).</li> </ul> No image from computer with Linux + Awesome WM <p>Sometimes Awesome WM on Linux can't recognize a video output change on a cable. That is, if the cable was first inserted into the monitor, and then you reconnected it to PiKVM - it may happen that you will not see the image. It seems that the problem is Awesome WM, since for example with KDE, it is not reproducable.

Use a small screwdriver or tweezers to fix the alignment. You may need to insert the screwdriver into the case along the inner face to push the low spacer towards the holes. See video for reference.</li> <li>Insert 4 screws into the holes of the case and tighten enough so things don't fall out, but leave plenty of slack - you might need to push the electronics around slightly to align the holes in the next steps.</li> <li>Now is a good time to power on the PiKVM and ensure the fan spins. It should come on automatically unless you explicitly disabled it yourself.</li> <li>Slide the back part over the PiKVM and align with the front part you assembled in previous steps.</li> <li>Ensure the case seats properly around the connectors.</li> <li>Insert the remaining four screws into the case and tighten. If the holes don't line up, you can hold the case while pushing on some of the PiKVM connectors to shift the electronics inside the case.</li> <li>Tighten all screws.</li> <li>Tip your bartender.</li> </ol>"}]}
